                Open source software (OSS) is said by many to be one of the primary staples in the
                infrastructure of modern technology. it is what helps drive innocation,
                transparency, and collaboration between developers and the users of a project.
                Nearly all software today relies on free, public code, written and maintained by
                communities of developers.
